# Foundations of Science I

Intellectual Foundations course offered by the STEM Center @ The University of Austin

This is a course unlike most traditional general science classes.  There are two modes:

1. Campus-wide lunch lectures on scientific topics.
	- This will substitute for one class period per week.

2. Seminar class to dig into scientific lecture and others.
	- The format will be mostly discussion and occasional lecture.
