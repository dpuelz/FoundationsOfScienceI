# Foundations of Science I

Intellectual Foundations course offered by the STEM Center @ The University of Austin

This is a course unlike most traditional general science classes.  There are two modes:

1. **Campus-wide lunch lectures on scientific topics.** This will substitute for one class period per week.

2. **Seminar class on scientific lectures and assigned readings.** The format will be mostly discussion and occasional lecture.

### Grading

- 30% evaluations on lunch lectures (either quizzes or reflections).
- 30% discussion participation, course engagement, homeworks (including reflection papers).
- 40% final oral exam.

### Main Readings

- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu) (FLP), including Six Easy Pieces (SEP) by Richard Feynman
- *The Biggest Ideas in the Universe* (BIU) by Sean Carroll

### Final Oral Exam

You will be asked to explain a scientific concept in great detail with clarity and rigor.
